The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Contactless Finger Knuckle Image Database Version 1.0

==========================================================================================

This finger knuckle images database consists of the finger dorsal images acquired from 503 different subjects. All the images were acquired using contactless imaging
setup. The images were acquired in the outdoor and also in the indoor environment from the male/female volunteers in the age group of 4-60 years. This database provides 
major and minor finger knuckle patterns from the middle finger of right hands from 503 different subjects with 5 images from each of the subject. All the images
are provided in *.bmp format. This database also provides automatically segmented major and minor finger knuckle images of 180 x 160 pixels from the corresponding
503 subjects. The segmentation algorithm is described in the T-IFS 2014 paper in the cited reference. This database also includes two session finger knuckle images 
acquired from the long interval to ascertain the stability of knuckle patterns.

"Details of Two Session Finger Images"

There are a total of 39 folders in 'Two-Session' image folder. Each of the folder represents a unique finger and has two session (A and B) images.
The segmented major knuckle images are also provided in the same folders. The month/year of the finger images for different folders is provided in the following. 


Folder Name	   Session #1 (A)   Session # 2 (B)

The two session finger images were acquired with different camera and mostly under different environments. The images have scale, illumination and pose variations as
the camera is held with hands (no tripod) while imaging. It should be noted that not all the finger images were used for the two-session performance evaluation reported 
in the paper and two-session performance still needs further work for the improvement in matching accuracy. These images are primarily intended to evaluate the knuckle matching 
capability for forensic applications and advance state-of-art in finger knuckle matching capabilities.
